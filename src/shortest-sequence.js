// A positive integer is given. The goal is to construct the shortest posible sequence 
// in integers ending with this integer, using the following rules:
// * The first element of the sequence is 1; more specifically: A[0] = 1
// * Each of the following element is generated by multiplying the previous element by 2 or
//    increasing it by 1; more precisely: A[i] = A[i-1] * 2 or A[i] = A[i-1] + 1, for i>=1
// INPUT: 18 -> OUTPUT: [1,2,4,8,9,18]
